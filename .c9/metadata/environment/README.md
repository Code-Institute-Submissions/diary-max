You are able to add images methods , ingredients and many more thing. Once you have stored and saved a recipe of your choice you are able to edit and delete a recipe that you have already created, you can do all of this with easy access.","","## UX","Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.","","In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:","","As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.","This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.","","# Features","### Existing Features","","This web application   allows users to store and access cooking recipes very easily. It is both fullstack and backend web application  that adds  all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality directly to a database hosted in the cloud on Heroku platform as a service. ","It allows users to do the following:","Add recipe-  once you fill out the add recipe form and you click on the submit recipe button it directly store the recipe in the recipe page which has it own uniqe layout.","My Recipes- this would allow you to view a all the recipes submitted by the current user that filled out the add recipe form.","### Features Left to Implement","1. I would like to add  a recipe planner where you would be able to add a recipe and a day you want to cook it, when the day arrives you would get a text message reminding you.","2. Dietary","# Technologies Used"," I have used the following  technologies:","HTML, CSS, JavaScript Python, front end from Materialize Full Stack Micro Framework Flask, SQL -relational database management system , pymongo","JQuery","The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.","### Testing","I have tested all of the CRUD functionallties and they all .","I have tested the responsiveness of the app and made sure it works on diffrent screen sizes i have tested it with the following sizes and they all work and it is very easy to maneuver around it:-","1.
